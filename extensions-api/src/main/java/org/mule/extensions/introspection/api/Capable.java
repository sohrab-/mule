 * An object is capable if it may provide different facet of additional information.

 * Capabilities provide a mechanism for specific extensions to the api that do not break clients but may provide additional
 * information on new (non-mandatory) aspects.
 * <p/>
 * <p>
 * When building a new Capability, you should consider that it may not be recognized or used at all by existing
 * consumers. This limits the use of this feature to non-critical stuff or to extended contracts targeting a specific
 * consumer.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Consumers of a capability must be prepared to deal with he fact that the object may not implement it
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Capabilities are used to provide a future-proof path to incorporate changes that may otherwise
 * break backwards compatibility. New information can be provided in a new class exposed when specifically queried
 * as a capability. Hence, clients that were not compiled with the new class in scope will not fail, and only
 * clients aware of a specific capability will use it (that's the reason why there's no enumeration of
 * capabilities in the interface)
